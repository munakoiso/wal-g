# WAL-G for MySQL

**Interface of MySQL and MariaDB now is unstable**

You can use wal-g as a tool for encrypting, compressing MySQL backups and push/fetch them to/from storage without saving it on your filesystem.

Configuration
-------------

* `WALG_MYSQL_DATASOURCE_NAME`

To configure the connection string for MySQL. Required. [DSN format](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name) ```user:password@tcp(host)/dbname```

* `WALG_MYSQL_SSL_CA`

To use SSL, a path to file with certificates should be set to this variable.

*  `WALG_STREAM_CREATE_COMMAND`

Command to create MySQL backup, should return backup as single stream to STDOUT. Requried.

*  `WALG_STREAM_RESTORE_COMMAND`

Command to unpack MySQL backup, should take backup (created by `WALG_STREAM_CREATE_COMMAND`) 
to STDIN and unpack it to MySQL datadir. Required.

* `WALG_MYSQL_BACKUP_PREPARE_COMMAND`

Command to prepare MySQL backup after restoring. Optional. Needed for xtrabackup case.

* `WALG_DELTA_MAX_STEPS`

Delta-backup is the difference between previously taken backup and present state. `WALG_DELTA_MAX_STEPS` determines how many delta backups can be between full backups. Defaults to 0 (disabled).
Restoration process will automatically fetch all necessary deltas and base backup and compose valid restored backup (you still need WALs after start of last backup to restore consistent cluster).
Delta computation is based on ModTime of file system and LSN number of pages in datafiles.

Note: Incremental backups only supported in `wal-g xtrabackup-push` command.

* `WALG_DELTA_ORIGIN`

To configure base for next delta backup (only if `WALG_DELTA_MAX_STEPS` is not exceeded). `WALG_DELTA_ORIGIN` can be LATEST (chaining increments), LATEST_FULL (for bases where volatile part is compact and chaining has no meaning - deltas overwrite each other). Defaults to LATEST.

Note: Incremental backups only supported in `wal-g xtrabackup-push` command.

* `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_REPLAY_COMMAND`

Command to replay binlog on running MySQL. Required for binlog-replay command.

* `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_DST`

To place binlogs in the specified directory during binlog-fetch, binlog-replay or binlog-server

* `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_HOST`
* `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_PORT`
* `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_USER`
* `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_PASSWORD`

To configure the data to connect the replica to for binlog server.

* `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_ID`

To configure the server id of the binlog server. Should be unique for each replica.

* `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_REPLICA_SOURCE`

To configure the connection string that will be used by `binlog-server` to connect to your MySQL. [DSN format](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name): ```user:password@tcp(host)/dbname```

> **Operations with binlogs**: If you'd like to do binlog operations with wal-g don't forget to [activate the binary log](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/activating-the-binary-log/) by starting mysql/mariadb with [--log-bin](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/replication-and-binary-log-server-system-variables/#log_bin) and [--log-basename](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysqld-options/#-log-basename)=\[name\].

* `WALG_STREAM_SPLITTER_PARTITIONS`

To configure split backup stream into several parts and upload them in parallel.
Backup file names have a suffix `_0000.bz`.

* `WALG_STREAM_SPLITTER_BLOCK_SIZE`

To configure block size (bytes) into which backup stream split. Blocks of this length size is put into each partition in turn.

* `WALG_STREAM_SPLITTER_MAX_FILE_SIZE`

To configure max file size (bytes) before compressing. If partition size become more than max file size, it split on several files.
Backup file names have a suffix `_0000_0000.bz`.

* `WALG_BACKUP_DOWNLOAD_MAX_RETRIES`

Configure max attempts to download backup file. Default value `1`.

Usage
-----

WAL-G mysql extension currently supports these commands:

### ``backup-push``

Creates new backup and send it to storage. Runs `WALG_STREAM_CREATE_COMMAND` to create backup.

```bash
wal-g backup-push
```

### ``xtrabackup-push``

Creates new backup with `xtrabackup` tool and send it to storage. Runs `WALG_STREAM_CREATE_COMMAND` to create backup.
WAL-G levereages knowledge of xtrabackup format to support additional feature (e.g. incremental backups)

```bash
wal-g xtrabackup-push
```

* `WALG_MYSQL_INCREMENTAL_BACKUP_DST`

To place incremental backup in the specified directory during backup-fetch

### ``backup-list``

Lists currently available backups in storage

```bash
wal-g backup-list
```

### ``backup-fetch``

Fetches backup from storage and restores it to datadir.
Runs `WALG_STREAM_RESTORE_COMMAND` to restore backup.
User should specify the name of the backup to fetch.

```bash
wal-g backup-fetch example_backup
```

WAL-G can also fetch the latest backup using:

```bash
wal-g backup-fetch  LATEST
```

### ``get-stream``
Download the specified backup as single stream (when backup is stream-based backup). This command will:
* decrypt backup
* decompress backup
* assemble parts of backups (when `WALG_STREAM_SPLITTER_*` used)
* save to file

Example:

``wal-g get-stream BACKUP_NAME path/to/local_file`` upload the local file to the storage.

``wal-g get-stream BACKUP_NAME | xbstream --extract`` upload the local file to the storage.

### ``binlog-push``

Sends (not yet archived) binlogs to storage. Typically run in CRON.

```bash
wal-g binlog-push
```

When `WALG_MYSQL_CHECK_GTIDS` is set wal-g will try to be upload only binlogs which GTID sets contains events that
wasn't seen before. This is done by parsing binlogs and peeking first PREVIOUS_GTIDS_EVENT that holds GTID set of
all executed transactions at the moment this particular binlog file created.
This feature may be useful when you are uploading binlogs from different hosts (e.g. after master switchower)
Note: Don't use `WALG_MYSQL_CHECK_GTIDS` when GTIDs are not used - it will slow down binlog upload.

### ``binlog-fetch``

Fetches binlogs from storage and saves them to `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_DST` folder.
User should specify the name of the backup starting with which to fetch an binlog.
User may also specify time in  RFC3339 format until which should be fetched (used for PITR).
User have to replay binlogs manually in that case.

```bash
wal-g binlog-fetch --since "backupname"
```
or
```bash
wal-g binlog-fetch --since "backupname" --until "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
```
or
```bash
wal-g binlog-fetch --since LATEST --until "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
```

You can stop wal-g from fetching newly created/modified binlogs by specifying `--until-binlog-last-modified-time` option.
This may be useful to achieve exact clones of the same database in scenarios when new binlogs are uploaded concurrently whith your restore process.

```bash
wal-g binlog-replay --since LATEST --until "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00" --until-binlog-last-modified-time "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
```

### ``binlog-replay``

Fetches binlogs from storage and passes them to `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_REPLAY_COMMAND` to replay on running MySQL server.
User should specify the name of the backup starting with which to fetch an binlog.
User may also specify time in  RFC3339 format until which should be fetched (used for PITR).
If `until` timestamp is in the future, wal-g will search for newly uploaded binlogs until no new found.
Binlogs are temporarily save in `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_DST` folder.
Replay command gets name of binlog to replay via environment variable `WALG_MYSQL_CURRENT_BINLOG` and stop-date via `WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_END_TS`, which are set for each invocation.

```bash
wal-g binlog-replay --since "backupname"
```
or
```bash
wal-g binlog-replay --since "backupname" --until "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
```
or
```bash
wal-g binlog-replay --since LATEST --until "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
```

You can stop wal-g from applying newly created/modified  binlogs by specifying `--until-binlog-last-modified-time` option.
This may be useful to achieve exact clones of the same database in scenarios when new binlogs are uploaded concurrently whith your restore process.

```bash
wal-g binlog-replay --since LATEST --until "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00" --until-binlog-last-modified-time "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
```

### ``binlog-server``

Runs mysql server implementation which can be used to fetch binlogs from storage and send them to MySQL slave by replication protocol.

```bash
wal-g binlog-server
```

### ``backup-mark``

Backups can be marked as permanent to prevent them from being removed when running ``delete``. To mark backup as permanent call `wal-g backup-mark -b backup_name`. To remove permanent flag - call `wal-g backup-mark -b backup_name -i`
When incremental backup is marked as permanent - all parent backups also marked as permanent.


Typical configurations
-----

### MySQL - using with `xtrabackup`


It's recommended to use wal-g with xtrabackup tool in case of MySQL for creating lock-less backups.
Here's typical wal-g configuration for that case:
```bash
 WALG_MYSQL_DATASOURCE_NAME=user:pass@tcp(localhost:3306)/mysql                                                                                                                                      
 WALG_STREAM_CREATE_COMMAND="xtrabackup --backup --stream=xbstream --datadir=/var/lib/mysql"                                                                                                                               
 WALG_STREAM_RESTORE_COMMAND="xbstream -x -C /var/lib/mysql"                                                                                                                       
 WALG_MYSQL_BACKUP_PREPARE_COMMAND="xtrabackup --prepare --target-dir=/var/lib/mysql"                                                                                              
 WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_REPLAY_COMMAND='mysqlbinlog --stop-datetime="$WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_END_TS" "$WALG_MYSQL_CURRENT_BINLOG" | mysql'
```

Restore procedure is a bit tricky:
* stop mysql
* clean a datadir (typically `/var/lib/mysql`)
* fetch and prepare desired backup using `wal-g backup-fetch "backup_name"`
* start mysql
* in case of you have replication and GTID enabled: set mysql GTID_PURGED variable to value from `/var/lib/mysql/xtrabackup_binlog_info`, using
```bash
gtids=$(tr -d '\n' < /var/lib/mysql/xtrabackup_binlog_info | awk '{print $3}')
mysql -e "RESET MASTER; SET @@GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED='$gtids';"
```
* for PITR, replay binlogs with
```bash
wal-g binlog-replay --since "backup_name" --until "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z"
```

### MySQL - using with `mysqldump`


It's possible to use wal-g with standard mysqldump/mysql tools.
In that case MySQL backup is a plain SQL script.
Here's typical wal-g configuration for that case:

```bash
 WALG_MYSQL_DATASOURCE_NAME=user:pass@tcp(localhost)/mysql                                                                                                               
 WALG_STREAM_CREATE_COMMAND="mysqldump --all-databases --single-transaction --set-gtid-purged=ON"                                                                                                                               
 WALG_STREAM_RESTORE_COMMAND="mysql"
 WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_REPLAY_COMMAND='mysqlbinlog --stop-datetime="$WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_END_TS" "$WALG_MYSQL_CURRENT_BINLOG" | mysql'
```

Restore procedure is straightforward:
* start mysql (it's recommended to create new mysql instance)
* fetch and apply desired backup using `wal-g backup-fetch "backup_name"`

### MySQL - PiTR with `wal-g binlog-server`

wal-g can work as replication source to do fast PiTR. In this case it will serve binlogs from storage directly to MySQL. It is expected that PiTR in this mode will be much faster than in classic approach because there won't be additional transformations from binlog to SQL, also you can benefit from multi-threaded replication.

```bash
 WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_HOST="127.0.0.1"
 WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_PORT=9306
 WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_USER="walg"
 WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_PASSWORD="walgpwd"
 WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_ID=99

 WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_SERVER_REPLICA_SOURCE="user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/db"
```

Restore procedure is straightforward:
* restore backup
* disable replication threads in MySQL: `skip-slave-start`
* start MySQL, purge GTIDs (see above)
* in second terminal start binlog-server: `wal-g binlog-server --until "1985-10-26T01:21:00Z"`
* in MySQL:
  ```SQL
    SET GLOBAL SERVER_ID=999
    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST="127.0.0.1", MASTER_PORT=9306, MASTER_USER="walg", MASTER_PASSWORD="walgpwd", MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1;
    SHOW SLAVE STATUS \G
    START SLAVE;
  ```
* wait until wal-g exit (it will wait until binlogs will be applied)
* in case of errors use classic approach

### MariaDB - using with `mariabackup`

It's recommended to use wal-g with `mariabackup` tool in case of MariaDB for creating lock-less backups.
Here's typical wal-g configuration for that case:
```bash
 WALG_MYSQL_DATASOURCE_NAME=user:pass@tcp(localhost:3305)/mysql                                                                                                                                      
 WALG_STREAM_CREATE_COMMAND="mariabackup --backup --stream=xbstream --datadir=/var/lib/mysql"                                                                                                                               
 WALG_STREAM_RESTORE_COMMAND="mbstream -x -C /var/lib/mysql"                                                                                                                       
 WALG_MYSQL_BACKUP_PREPARE_COMMAND="mariabackup --prepare --target-dir=/var/lib/mysql"                                                                                              
 WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_REPLAY_COMMAND='mysqlbinlog --stop-datetime="$WALG_MYSQL_BINLOG_END_TS" "$WALG_MYSQL_CURRENT_BINLOG" | mysql'
```

For the restore procedure you have to do similar things to [what the offical docs says about full backup and restore](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/full-backup-and-restore-with-mariabackup/):
* stop mariadb
* clean a datadir (typically `/var/lib/mysql`)
* fetch and prepare desired backup using `wal-g backup-fetch "backup_name"`
* after the previous step you might have to fix file permissions: `chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql`
* start mariadb
* WAL-G doesn't support automatic PITR for MariaDB. There are 2 possible workarounds:
  * You can configure restored database to replicate from your master, so it will be able to catch up (follow the [official docs](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/setting-up-a-replication-slave-with-mariabackup/#gtids))
  * You can manually replay events with binlog and position:
```bash
wal-g binlog-fetch --since [backup name | LATEST]
# Get binlog-name, position and GTIDs:
tail -n 1 < /var/lib/mysql/xtrabackup_binlog_info
# eg 'mysql-bin.000005	385	0-1-5763'
# then replay it manually:
mysql -e "STOP ALL SLAVES; SET GLOBAL gtid_slave_pos='$gtids';"
mysqlbinlog --stop-datetime="some point in time" --start-position [position above] [all binlogs starting from thouse we seen above] | mysql --user XXX --host YYY [other options]
```

### MariaDB - using with `mysqldump`

The procedure is same as in case of [MySQL. You can follow the instructions from the previous section.](#mysql---using-with-mysqldump)
